### Hi! I'm Eric 🌺

  On the path to become a systems engineer with profient knowledge in both hardware and software related fields
  to be a versatile teamm player for a group.🖥️🖱️
  
  🖥️ Aspiring Systems Engineer with a passion for both hardware and software  
  🎒 Proficient in C++  
  📘 Currently advancing in Python  
  🛠️ Skilled in crafting custom-built PCs and maintaining them for optimal performance  
  🔍 Strong problem-solving skills, demonstrated by diagnosing and replacing defective parts in custom builds  
  📚 Constantly expanding my knowledge and skills to excel in the world of systems engineering  
  🟣 Fun fact: I love to play games and livestream them for an audience  

  One of the personal best projects consisted of gathering a group of computer components: CPU, Motherboard, GPU, Memory, Storage, PSU, CPU Cooler, and Case
  and successfully constructed a system that was fully operational and optemized for maximum performance through overclocking and voltage tuning. Soon after I took on
  another project that led to me having to diagnose a defective part in a custom build, successfully replace it and return the PC to a stable condition
