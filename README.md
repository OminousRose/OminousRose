### Hi! I'm Eric 🌺

On the path to become a systems engineer with profient knowledge in both hardware and software related fields
to be a versatile teamm player for a group.🖥️🖱️

  🎒 Proficient in C++ with novice level experience in Python
  📘 Currently advancing in Python
  🛠️ Experienced in crafting custom built PCs and maintaining them
  🟣 Fun fact: I love to play games and livestream them for an audience

  One of the personal best projects consisted of gathering a group of computer components: CPU, Motherboard, GPU, Memory, Storage, PSU, CPU Cooler, and Case
  and successfully constructed a system that was fully operational and optemized for maximum performance through overclocking and voltage tuning. Soon after I took on
  another project that led to me having to diagnose a defective part in a custom build, successfully replace it and return the PC to a stable condition
